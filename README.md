A meteor package for [lodash](http://lodash.com/).

Use with `lodash`.  
`_` is still underscore.

To use `_` just add the following to the top of the file
```
var _ = lodash;
```

or wrap your code in a closure if you're feeling really diligent
```javascript
(function(_) {
    // code
})(lodash);
```
